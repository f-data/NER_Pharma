Novartis announced on July 9 that it will make its generic prefilled epinephrine shots (Symjepi) immediately available in all U.S. pharmacies.
Novartis’s Sandoz division initially launched the treatment in January for use in hospitals and clinics, but the company is now working to introduce both the adult (0.3 mg) and pediatric (0.15 mg) doses into the retail market so that patients can have access to the medicine at their local pharmacies.
The wholesale price for a two-pack of adult-dose syringes is $250, making it cheaper than the $300 charged by both Mylan and Teva for their respective generics of Mylan’s EpiPen Auto-Injector.
Novartis’s announcement comes amid a shortage of Mylan’s EpiPen, which was added to FDA’s list of drug shortages on May 9, 2018—over 1 year ago. Pfizer’s Meridian Medical Technologies, which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St. Louis, MO, attributes the shortage to manufacturing problems.
In an effort to mitigate the shortage, FDA has coordinated with Mylan and Pfizer to extend the expiration date of all lots of EpiPen 0.3 mg auto-injectors and its authorized generic version by 4 months. This extension does not apply to the pediatric dose, EpiPen Jr.
More information about the expiration extension and a list of the affected lots can be found in Mylan and Pfizer’s letter on FDA’s website. Patients can also check EpiPen’s website to see if their EpiPen’s expiration date has been extended.
More information on the drug shortage is available on FDA’s website.
