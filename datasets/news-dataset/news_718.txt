The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning not to supply prednisolone from five batches of 5mg tablets to patients with sight problems following a Braille misprint on the packaging.
In a drug alert issued on 26 April 2019, the MHRA said that an error in the Braille on the packaging, manufactured by Genethics Europe Ltd and distributed by Genesis Pharmaceuticals Ltd, has wrongly stated the strength of the tablets as 1mg instead of 5mg.
“There is a risk to patients who have compromised eyesight and who rely solely on Braille to determine their tablet strength,” the MHRA drug alert said, warning that the batches “should not be dispensed to patients who rely solely on Braille”.
“We understand that alternative batches of the product are available from a number of suppliers,” it added.
Prednisolone is a steroid used to treat a range of allergies, blood disorders, skin diseases, infections, some cancers and to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.
