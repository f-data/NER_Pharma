Sanofi has been among the pharma companies hardest hit by U.S. pricing pressure in diabetes, and now, competition is taking a toll on a prized asset from its $11.6 billion Bioverativ buyout.
In the first quarter, hemophilia drug Eloctate's sales of €174 missed consensus estimates of €204 million by 14.7%, ODDO BHF analysts wrote in a note to clients. A 4.2% dip in Q1 year-over-year sales was "attributable to tougher competition" in the U.S. thanks to Roche's Hemlibra, they wrote.
Eloctate isn't the only drug the Roche newcomer is threatening. In October, it picked up a nod in hemophilia A patients without factor VIII inhibitors, broadening its patient pool significantly and setting it up to challenge Eloctate and other hemophilia A treatments. Thanks to big efficacy numbers and a convenient subcutaneous dosing regimen, analysts expect it to rack up $2 billion or more by 2025.

Sanofi picked up Eloctate in last year's $11.6 billion buyout of hemophilia-focused Bioverativ. The deal was one of several moves by the French drugmaker intended to shift the company away from a reliance on primary care and bring it further into rare diseases.
Execs didn't much want to discuss Eloctate's long-term future on Friday's Q1 earnings call, though, instead pointing to pipeline med BIVV001, which has turned in promising data to date.
Luckily for Sanofi, even amid the Eloctate slide and primary care struggles in the first quarter—the unit's sales fell 17%—the company turned in growth, thanks to standouts in rare diseases and vaccines.
