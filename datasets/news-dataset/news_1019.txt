Federal officials said Thursday that Miami-Luken, an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and two of its former executives have been charged for their roles in the U.S. opioid crisis. This is the second U.S. criminal case against a drug distributor regarding its role in the deadly opioid epidemic. The indictment charges Springboro, OH-based Miami-Luken, the company's former president, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with conspiring to distribute controlled substances. Federal prosecutors in Cincinnati assert that the company and its executives failed to safeguard the deadly drugs it shipped to pharmacies in five states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to DEA. According to prosecutors, Miami-Luken shipped millions of opioids to rural Appalachia, including 3.7 million doses of hydrocodone from 2008 to 2011 to a West Virginia pharmacy in a town with just 400 people. Two pharmacists who ordered drugs from Miami-Luken, which discontinued operations last October, have also been charged. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors in Manhattan brought the first opioid-related criminal case against Rochester Drug Co-operative Inc., and the company paid $20 million to resolve the charges.
