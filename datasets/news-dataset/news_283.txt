The #FierceMadness final game is set—and it’ll be GlaxoSmithKline's Trelegy taking on Boehringer Ingelheim's Ofev for the 2019 title.
In Final Four action, GSK’s catchy tune and message for COPD drug Trelegy propelled it to the final. It easily dismantled Amgen’s shadow emergency worker campaign for Repatha with a score of 1,216-651.
While a few commenters called the Trelegy jingle “annoying,” the overwhelming majority praised its catchiness and ease of message. As one voter said, “Great ad that engages patients with a clear and compelling message. The familiar tune also makes the message stick.”
In the other matchup, Boehringer Ingelheim’s boxing son talking about his father’s idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for Ofev topped Amgen and Novartis’ Aimovig migraine ups-and-downs of life by a final tally of 2,594-1,875.
Commenters continued to note the empathy and realness in the Aimovig work not being afraid to show the good and the bad in a migraine sufferer’s life, but the final nod went to Ofev with comments like, “very emotional ad with a message of hope and resilience.”
