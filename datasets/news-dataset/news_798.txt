The managing director of Rowlands Pharmacy, Kenny Black, is to leave the company after 20 years to “pursue new career opportunities”.
“We are sorry that Kenny is leaving the business and we are immensely grateful for what he has achieved during his time with us,” said Steve Anderson, managing director of Phoenix’s UK Group, which owns Rowlands Pharmacy.
“We thank him for that and all of us wish him every success in the future.”
According to Anderson, a new Rowlands’ managing director will be appointed “shortly”.
In February 2019, Rowlands Pharmacy announced that it had put 70 of its stores up for sale, equating to 14% of its 516 pharmacies across Great Britain.
Speaking to The Pharmaceutical Journal in March 2019, Black said that a smaller company would enable them to invest in technology to free up staff from dispensing duties.
“We want to invest significantly in the estate, which we are doing through automation and our monitored dosage system pouches,” he said.
“We’re also looking at automation to take the burden of repeat dispensing out of the pharmacy and free up time for the pharmacist to carry out services — we want to align with all the services that the UK government sees pharmacy doing.
“That’s easier to do if we’ve got a smaller estate. So we want to invest in a smaller, easier-to-manage business.”
