High-potency drugs remain in high demand, and Cambrex continues to build new facilities to capture that market. Its facility in Iowa will be ready to churn out active pharmaceutical ingredients beginning in May.
The East Rutherford, New Jersey-based small molecule specialist has completed a new $24 million facility in Charles City, Iowa. The 6,000-square-foot, four-reactor facility is currently being validated, the company said Wednesday.
With reactors that range from 200 to 1,000 gallons in capacity, the facility can handle projects up to 300 kg and support all phases of development, Cambrex said. A spokesman said in an email that Cambrex will add a dozen new jobs.

“We have seen an increased number of molecules in the clinical pipeline being designated as potent and highly potent, so having the flexibility within our manufacturing network to scale up with existing customers as projects progress, as well as accommodate new projects, is crucial to meet those market needs,” John Andrews, VP of operations and director for the Charles City site, said in a statement.
Cambrex manufactures a range of APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates including highly potent molecules and controlled substances at the Iowa site, where it employs more than 370 people.
Other companies are scaling up their high-potency API capabilities as well. A year ago, South Africa’s Aspen Pharmacare opened an $80 million facility at its site in Port Elizabeth.
