The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FDA) have issued warning letters to four companies that manufacture, advertise, and offer for sale or distribution flavored e-liquid products for violations related to online posts by social media influencers on the companies' behalf. "Years of progress to combat youth use of tobacco is now threatened by an epidemic of e-cigarette use by kids, and unfortunately research shows many youth are mistaken or unaware of the risks and the presence of nicotine in e-cigarettes. That's why it's critical we ensure manufacturers, retailers and others are including the required health warning about nicotine's addictive properties on packages and advertisementsâ€”especially on social media platforms popular with kids," said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, MD. According to FDA, the e-liquid products labeled and/or advertised on behalf of the companies' own social media accounts because they do not include the required nicotine warning statement. The agency said that through sites such as Facebook and Instagram, posts on behalf of Solace Technologies LLC, Hype City Vapors LLC, Humble Juice Co. LLC, and Artist Liquids Laboratories LLC included content that promoted the flavored e-liquid products or recommended their followers try the products without the nicotine warning statement. The companies have 15 business days to respond to FDA and FTC with specific plans of actions to address the agencies' concerns.
