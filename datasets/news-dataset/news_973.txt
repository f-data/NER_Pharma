CVS Health reports it will expand its HealthHub store model it recently tested, pushing deeper into health services with plans to add dietitians, medical equipment, and space for the occasional yoga class to 1,500 stores over the next few years. The HealthHub stores will have about twice as much space devoted to health care as other locations and will aim to help people with chronic conditions such as diabetes. "The ultimate goal is bring more health services into people's communities where they can access them as part of their daily life," says CVS Health Executive Vice President Alan Lotvin, MD. HealthHub stores also give customers a chance to get screened for eye problems caused by diabetes, talk to a pharmacist about their treatment plan or get help tracking their blood pressure. The community pharmacy chain started testing the changes in Houston late last year and will add more to that market this year as well as expand to Atlanta, the Philadelphia area, and Tampa. CVS is offering additional health care in stores many customers already visit routinely and is focused on putting those customers on "a path to better health," says CVS Health Executive Vice President Kevin Hourican.
