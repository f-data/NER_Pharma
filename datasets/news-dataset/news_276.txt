Countless lawsuits have sought to estimate the costs of fixing the U.S. opioid and addiction epidemic. Now, thanks to an expert in Oklahoma's ongoing trial against Johnson & Johnson, we have one dollar figure.
Oklahoma would have to spend nearly $285 million to mount a countermarketing campaign that would offset pharma’s influence over pain prescribing, Saxum Strategic Communications chairman and CEO Renzi Stone testified during the state’s trial against Johnson & Johnson on Monday.
And that's just the cost of a campaign to spread awareness about the harms of opioids, Stone pointed out in testimony reported by the Oklahoman. It doesn't include the other costs of fixing the state's opioid crisis.
“Frankly, I am blown away and impressed,” Stone said of J&J’s opioid marketing at the trial, according to testimony posted by the newspaper. “The marketing materials, the depth of research, the significance of stakeholder mapping, the creation of budgets, the size of budgets, the quarterly review is breathtaking.”
