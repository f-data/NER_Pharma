Eli Lilly's Emgality didn't just hit the next-generation migraine market in third place behind Amgen and Novartis' Aimovig and Teva's Ajovy. It's been trailing its CGRP rivals in early sales results, too. But now, Emgality is alone in boasting a cluster headache approval.
Tuesday, the FDA approved Emgality to treat patients with cluster headache during a cluster period. The nod followed a breakthrough designation—which the FDA grants to treatments for patients who lack other options—and a priority review granted earlier this year. It's now the only FDA-approved drug for the condition.
Lilly is expecting quick uptake, because cluster headache patients are "very motivated" to find new treatments and have felt "marginalized" for years, Eric Pearlman, senior medical director in neuroscience at Lilly, said in an interview. Patients describe the pain as a knife or hot poker to the eye, Pearlman noted, and their eyes can grow teary, swell and redden. They're often misdiagnosed—leading to unnecessary eye surgeries, sinus surgeries or tooth extractions.
“We’re not talking about a second indication for Emgality,” Pearlman said. “We’re talking about an innovative therapy for 250,000 patients [in the United States].”
As Lilly's vice president of neuroscience Libby Driscoll said, cluster headaches are actually “very different” from migraines. They're unpredictable, sudden attacks that happen for weeks or months at a time. And whereas migraine patients often retreat to a dark room, cluster headache patients are agitated and restless, Pearlman said. Some injure themselves as a consequence of the pain.
