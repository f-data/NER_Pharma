Biopharma executive pay and drug pricing gin up plenty of headlines on their own. For the second year in a row, a group of investors is trying to spotlight the links between them.
With shareholder resolutions at six top U.S. drugmakers—AbbVie, Celgene, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Pfizer and Vertex—the investors aim to learn how price changes factor into sales goals and other exec pay metrics. The resolutions, up for votes at the companies' annual meetings, ask the drugmakers whether they use price increases to meet their sales goals, whether boards must approve price hikes, and more.
As members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of 300 faith communities and other organizations that use investments as levers for social change, the biopharma investors have gone after drug companies on pricing several times before. Last year, the investors filed similar resolutions with AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, and they generated shareholder support ranging from 21% to 28%.
