FDA approved on Wednesday dupilumab (Dupixentâ€”Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) for the treatment of adults with nasal polyps accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis. "Nasal polyps can lead to loss of smell and often patients require surgery to remove the polyps," said Sally Seymour, MD, director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Dupixent provides an important treatment option for patients whose nasal polyps are not adequately controlled with intranasal steroids. It also reduces the need for nasal polyp surgery and oral steroids." The drug was originally approved in 2017 for individuals aged 12 years and older with eczema that is not controlled adequately by topical therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Two studies involving more than 700 patients found that patients taking dupilumab had statistically significant reductions in their nasal polyp size and nasal congestion compared with placebo recipients. Additionally, they reported a greater ability to smell and needed less nasal polyp surgery and oral steroids. Dupilumab can cause serious allergic reactions and eye problems, including conjunctivitis and keratitis. The most common adverse effects reported include injection site reactions and eye and eyelid inflammation. This application received Priority Review from FDA.
