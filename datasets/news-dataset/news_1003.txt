CVS Pharmacy has started a new program to verify the ingredients of the vitamins and supplements it sells. The community pharmacy's "Tested to Be Trusted" program requires all vitamins and supplements sold in stores or online to undergo third-party testing to confirm that the ingredients listed for those products are correct. The process is also meant to screen products for too-high levels of substances such as heavy metals and pesticides. Company officials report that more than 1,400 products from 152 brands have been tested so far, and that 7% of products failed the test and were either given updated labels or removed. "We are seeing more customers focus on self-care as part of their overall health," said CVS Pharmacy president Kevin Hourican. "CVS is committed to providing access to new products and categories to empower people to practice self-care in their daily lives, especially since self-care varies based on an individualâ€™s needs." The type of products that are being tested include vitamins, probiotics, melatonin, glucosamine, and herbals, such as ginkgo biloba. The move is in line with other efforts by the pharmacy to increase the health of its offerings.
