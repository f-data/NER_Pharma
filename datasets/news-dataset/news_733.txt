Staff working for NHS Tayside are being balloted on industrial action over treatment of pharmacy support staff.
Unite the Union is holding the vote of its members following claims that the support staff are on a lower pay grade than they should be.
Press reports say the ballot will cover industrial action short of a strike, with an overtime ban being a possiblilty if union members vote to take action.
George Doherty, director of workforce at NHS Tayside, said the union had raised an issue relating to the pay grading process of band 2 pharmacy support workers.
He said the health board was “disappointed” by the union’s decision to ballot and added that NHS Tayside was “assured that the pharmacy support workers’ review has been dealt with fairly and appropriately, in partnership through the Agenda for Change process, and agreed both locally and nationally”.
