Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma on Tuesday signed a revised pharmacy choice bill into law, 3 weeks after vetoing an earlier version. House Bill 2632 prohibits restrictions on a patient's right to choose a pharmacy provider without paying a penalty and calls for an advisory committee to review complaints and administer fines. In his veto message, Stitt said SB 841 attempted to regulate certain health plans in a way that is not allowed by federal law. The governor called on the Legislature to develop a compromise on the issue. "We fixed the issue to the governor's satisfaction," said HB 2632's author, Rep. Jon Echols (R-Oklahoma City). The pharmacy choice bills were written to regulate pharmacy PBMs. Opponent, urged the governor to veto both bills, predicting that prescription drug costs will increase for Oklahoma families. A House fiscal impact analysis shows the cost to the state in increased prescription drug costs would be $7.2 million annually, and the cost of staff to regulate the law would be at least $350,000 annually.
