According to federal health officials, this year's outbreak is due in large part to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children because of misinformation. "We cannot say this enough: Vaccines are a safe and highly effective public health tool that can prevent this disease and end the current outbreak," said HHS Secretary Alex Azar.
