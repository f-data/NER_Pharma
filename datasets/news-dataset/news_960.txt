CVS Health announced Monday that it will spend $10 million in support of efforts to prevent youth use of e-cigarettes. According to the company, the sum is part of its 5-year, $50 million "Be The First" campaign to "help deliver the nation's first tobacco-free generation." The new contribution will be funded through CVS and the CVS Health and Aetna Foundations. Troyen Brennan, MD, chief medical officer for CVS Health, said in a statement that the "spread of e-cigarette use among youth jeopardizes the progress made in reducing smoking over the last 2 decades." He added, "By collaborating with experts and aggressively investing in innovative strategies, we believe that we can help reverse this disturbing trend." Some of the efforts receiving funding this year include programs to create and distribute educational materials for middle and high schools students about the risks of vaping, a $100,000 grant for the Society of Health and Physical Educators to distribute educational games from the Yale Center for Health and Learning to schools nationwide, and $600,000 to support the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation's efforts to address the rising emergence of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.
