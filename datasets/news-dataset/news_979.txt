As foreign-made generic blood-pressure medications tainted with probable carcinogens continue to be recalled, U.S. lawmakers are seeking more information about regulators' capacity to protect the nation's drug supply. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR), the panel's top Republican, want details on FDA's ability to adequately inspect foreign and domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The lawmakers are seeking specific information regarding a recall of the drug valsartan that was manufactured by Chinese firm Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. They also want more details about a dispute between senior FDA staff and an inspector who visited one of the company's plants where medication contaminated with the probable human carcinogen NDMA was first detected. In a letter to the Government Accountability Office on Friday, Pallone, Walden, and other committee leaders asked the investigator to examine the number of inspections that FDA conducts of foreign and domestic drug-manufacturing facilities, what resources the agency dedicates to its foreign offices, and how it chooses facilities to inspect. In a separate letter, the committee leaders asked FDA for unredacted documents related to the initial valsartan recall in July 2018.
