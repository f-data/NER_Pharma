Gilead Sciences used its monopoly on one critical component in HIV combo meds to stifle generic competition and keep prices high, a new lawsuit claims—and the Big Biotech did so with the help of combo partners Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
In a class action lawsuit, HIV and AIDS activists say Gilead teamed with Bristol-Myers, J&J's Janssen unit and Japan Tobacco to knock back competition to HIV cocktail meds. The companies agreed to stick with patent-protected ingredients in their fixed-dose combination drugs, rather than sub in low-cost generics, even after patents expired on the individual components, the lawsuit claims.
The strategy forced much higher prices over time, the lawsuit claims. Even after exclusivity lapsed for some components of the meds—which are key to HIV treatment because they drastically reduce the number of pills patients need to take—Gilead’s fixed-dosed-combination drug Complera sells for $35,000 per year, the plaintiffs say. A version using available generic components—plus Janssen’s still-patent-protected Edurant—would cost half that, the suit alleges.
A Gilead spokesman said the company "entered into partnerships with other companies with the goal of bringing life-saving therapies to patients in need."
"Any suggestion that we had improper motives is absolutely false," he added.
A BMS representative said the company is reviewing the complaint; J&J didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit follows a string of headlines about Gilead's HIV business over the past week: First, the company disclosed Truvada, its drug approved to treat and prevent infection, would face early generics, and then it agreed to pony up free drugs as part of a national PrEP push. And earlier this week, a California judge refused to dismiss a separate lawsuit claiming Gilead illegally delayed its next-gen HIV meds to milk as much revenue as possible from its current generation before the older drugs went off patent.
