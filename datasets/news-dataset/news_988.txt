San Francisco's Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to ban the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes in the city, a move that seeks to curb what experts have described as a nicotine epidemic among teenagers. "We've worked for decades to decrease tobacco usage and try to end nicotine addiction," said Shamann Walton, a co-author of the bill banning e-cigarettes, which will go into effect 30 days after it is signed by the mayor. "Now you have this device loaded with nicotine and chemicals thatâ€™s drawing people to addiction. We need to keep it out of the hands of young people." Researchers have expressed concern that a blanket ban on e-cigarettes could harm the wider goals of anti-tobacco efforts by eliminating what experts consider a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes. But the measure was praised by anti-tobacco advocates and the American Heart Association, among other health organizations. Merchants will be allowed 6 months to deplete their stock, and the ban will not affect the sale of conventional cigarettes or cannabis joints. Dennis Herrera, the city attorney and a co-author of the bill, said the law would be in place until FDA conducts a full-scale assessment of e-cigarettes.
