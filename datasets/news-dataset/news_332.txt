Allergan Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders gets to keep both his titles, thanks to a shareholder vote that broke in his favor. But he answered critics Tuesday with a promise that Allergan's weighing all its options now—including a split—with a "sense of urgency."
Saunders made that pledge as Allergan reported first-quarter results—including a painful $2.5 billion write-down on its failed antidepressant rapastinel—and after meetings with more than 50 investors over the past few months, the CEO said.
Even after shareholders last week voted against separating the company's CEO and chairman jobs, the helmsman said his company has heard investor concerns “loud and clear.”
Some analysts have been calling for a split for years as Allergan's shares have faltered, and the company did put a couple of its business units on the market, if unsuccessfully. But until recently, the idea was a non-starter. And now? It’s considering just that, along with a range of other options to boost shareholder value. “Everything is on the table,” Saunders said.
“I’ve always remained open-minded, and the board remains open-minded, to that idea if it’s something that creates long-term value,” Saunders said.
