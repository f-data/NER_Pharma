The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), along with other organizations, released a draft of new guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease.
The guidelines strongly recommend prophylactic antibiotic therapy to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of a high-risk tick bite. A tick bite is considered high risk if it’s from an Ixodes tick, in a highly endemic area, and from a tick engorged and attached for 36 hours or more. The preferred antibiotic regimen for an Ixodes high-risk tick bite is a single dose of oral doxycycline.
For treatment of early localized Lyme disease, also known as erythema migrans, the guidelines strongly recommend either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, or phenoxymethylpenicillin rather than a longer treatment course.
The guidelines also cover Lyme disease testing and diagnosis, as well as evaluating patients with “chronic” Lyme disease.
IDSA collaborated with the American Academy of Neurology and the American College of Rheumatology on the guidelines. The organization has opened up the draft for public comment, which runs through August 10, 2019. The guidelines will update a previous version issued more than a decade ago.
