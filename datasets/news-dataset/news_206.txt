It took Novartis' Sandoz years to reach the market with a generic to United Therapeutics’ pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Remodulin, but last month, the company managed to do just that. Now, there’s a big problem hindering the generic launch, Sandoz alleges in a new lawsuit (PDF): United Therapeutics is blocking generic uptake by teaming with a devicemaker for exclusive access to pumps that administer the drug.
Sandoz and its generic marketing partner RareGen on Tuesday sued United Therapeutics and device company Smiths Medical for placing “artificial restrictions” that block access to Remodulin generics and maintain high prices. To do so, they allege, United and Smiths have instructed pharmacies dispensing treprostinil, the generic name for Remodulin, that Smiths' pumps can only be used with the branded version, and the device company has also threatened to stop selling its cartridges if pharmacies administer the generic version of the drug.
The result is that PAH patients who get the drug subcutaneously, or more than half of Remodulin patients, can’t get access to generics, the suit claims.
A United spokesman said the company is "disappointed at the meritless lawsuit." He said Smiths announced in 2015 it was discontinuing the pump, and in response, United invested to make sure the pump would continue to be available. Without that deal, "thousands of very sick PAH patients may not have been able to access necessary therapy," he added.
