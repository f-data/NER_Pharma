FDA on Thursday approved dalteparin sodium (Fragminâ€”Pfizer) injection to reduce the recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children as young as age 1 month. "Most children who have VTE are fighting a serious underlying primary illness such as cancer or congenital heart disease. Not only are they fighting a serious illness, having a condition like VTE can then lead to significant complications and even death," said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Prior to this approval, there had been no FDA-approved therapies to treat VTE in pediatric patients." The drug, a type of heparin, was first approved by FDA in 1994 for adults. The efficacy of dalteparin sodium in children was based on a trial involving 38 pediatric patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. At study completion, 21 children achieved resolution of the qualifying VTE, 7 showed regression, 2 showed no change, 1 experienced recurrence of VTE, and none experienced progression of the VTE. Common adverse effects of patients taking the drug include bleeding, including hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, hematoma or pain at the injection site, and transient elevation of transaminases. The label for dalteparin sodium includes a boxed warning about the risk of epidural or spinal hematomas that may occur in patients who are anticoagulated due to taking certain low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Health care professionals are advised to consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures as patients may be at a higher risk of developing VTE.
