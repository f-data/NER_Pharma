The General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) has carried out 303 unannounced inspections since its new system for the inspection of registered pharmacists was introduced on 1 April 2019.
A spokesperson for the GPhC said the unannounced inspections were carried out between 1 April 2019 and 9 May 2019. The system is due to be phased in during the 2019/2020 financial year, with the first inspection results published in the first quarter.
As part of its changes to inspections, the GPhC also introduced intelligence-led and themed inspections.
According to the regulator, some intelligence-led inspections have been carried out since early April 2019. These inspections are prompted by concerns raised by regulators, healthcare professionals and the public, as well as from journalists and the media.
The GPhC was unable to provide exact figures on the number of intelligence-led inspections that have taken place but said it would be looking to start providing these numbers in the future.
The first themed inspection, which will involve visiting a selection of pharmacies to focus on specific themes or issues in more depth, is due to take place in the second half of 2019.
The spokesperson for the GPhC said they were yet to decide on a theme. Following themed inspections, a report will be produced that identifies learning and good practice that can be shared across the pharmacy sector.
