After peaking in 2009, new cases of diagnosed diabetes in the United States have dropped by 35%, according to CDC researchers. Additionally, new cases of diabetes decreased from 1.7 million new cases per year in 2008 to 1.3 million new cases in 2017. CDC also noted that the number of people living with diagnosed diabetes has remained stable over the past 8 years. The findings, reported in Open Diabetes Research and Care, represent the longest sustained plateau in existing cases of diagnosed diabetes and the longest decline in new cases of the disease. "The findings suggest that our work to stem the tide of type 2 diabetes may be working—but we still have a very long way to go," said Ann Albright, PhD, director of CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation. "We must continue proven interventions and deploy innovative strategies if we're going to see a continued decline in type 2 diabetes among Americans." Using 1980–2017 cross-sectional survey data from CDC's National Health Interview Survey, the researchers found that the number of people living with diagnosed diabetes rose by 4.4% annually from 1990–2009, peaking at 8.2 per 100 adults. The number plateaued to 8 per 100 adults in 2017. Similar trends were also reflected for all ages, racial and ethnic groups, sexes, and education levels. Although the causes of the plateau and decrease are not known, the researchers suggest they could be, in part, the result of greater awareness of type 2 diabetes prevention, changes in diet and physical activity, and changes in diabetes diagnostic and screening methods.
