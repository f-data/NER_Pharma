Opening statements were heard Tuesday in the nation's first trial over whether a pharmaceutical company is liable for the opioid crisis. Lawyers for Oklahoma accused Johnson & Johnson of creating a deadly demand for the drugs, while the company responded that it had acted responsibly and lawfully in its quest to offer relief to chronic pain patients. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has argued that Johnson & Johnson followed in the footsteps of Purdue Pharma in promoting opioids for widespread pain. That shift played down the risk of addiction and created a public health crisis, plaintiffs argue, for which the pharmaceutical industry should now pay to alleviate. The state cited two businesses Johnson & Johnson owned that made the narcotic raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients used in drug companies' opioid analgesics. Larry Ottaway, an attorney for Johnson & Johnson, said the company followed federal guidelines on the volume of active pharmaceutical ingredients it could produce. Johnson & Johnson argued its drugs accounted for a fraction of those taken in Oklahoma and that an influx of illegal heroin and fentanyl were the real culprits of overdose deaths. The outcome of the 2-month trial will be decided solely by Judge Thad Balkman.
