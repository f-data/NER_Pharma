This week, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) made several recommendations for influenza vaccine in children as the 2019–2020 flu season approaches. Updates include
–Both inactivated influenza vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine can be options for children.
–All pediatric influenza vaccines will be quadrivalent vaccines, and the age indication has been expanded for use in those ages 6 months and older.
–New formulations of licensed influenza vaccines with a volume of 0.5 mL per dose have been approved for children ages 6 months through 36 months. Children 6 months through 35 months may now receive either the 0.25- or 0.5-mL dose, with no preference. Older children should continue receiving the 0.5-mL dose.
CDC reiterated these same recommendations in the August 23 edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The report updates recommendations from CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice on use of vaccines for this season and discusses which strains will be included.
