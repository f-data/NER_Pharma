FDA warned Thursday that two adults developed invasive infections, and one of them died, after receiving fecal transplants that contained drug-resistant bacteria. The transplants are used to treat Clostridium difficile infections in individuals who have not responded to standard treatments. According to FDA, the two patients had compromised immune systems and received transplants from the same donor. Their infections were caused by Escherichia coli that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. FDA noted that the donor stool was not tested for the drug-resistant bacteria before the transplant. The agency is now mandating that potential donors be screened with questions and that all donor stool be tested for drug-resistant bacteria.
