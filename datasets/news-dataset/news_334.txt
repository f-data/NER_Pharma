Johnson & Johnson's brand-new depression spray Spravato already faces a few challenges. It's restricted to use in a doctor's office, for one, and its efficacy data aren't uniformly positive. And now, a U.S. cost watchdog says it's overpriced, too.
Spravato, a reformulation of the tranquilizer-turned-street drug ketamine, won FDA approval to treat resistant depression, and the agency hailed it at the time as a much-needed option for patients who don't get relief from other drugs.
But it costs too much, according to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which released its assessment Thursday—and threw down a gauntlet about the clinical need. It's “concerning to have an overpriced therapy where there is such need for treatment,” ICER Chief Medical Officer David Rind said in a statement.
A Janssen spokesperson said the company disagrees with the assessment. ICER's report "underestimates the proven short- and long-term benefits that this treatment, which was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, brings to [treatment resistant depression] patients in need.
"Furthermore, the inaccurate assumptions in the draft report on the established positive benefit risk profile of Spravato are misguided," she added.
Before rebates and discounts, Spravato ranges from $4,720 to $6,785 for the first month of treatment and $2,360 to $3,540 after that, ICER said. Quoting a typical benchmark for cost-effectiveness, the body said Spravato treatment would cost $198,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. An acceptable number would fall in the $50,000 to $150,000 range, ICER said.
The drug is approved as an add-on to oral antidepressants in patients who have tried at least two antidepressants without success. It’s chemically similar to ketamine, which is used legally in anesthesia, but also illegally as a street drug.
