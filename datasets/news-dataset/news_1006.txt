CVS Health on Tuesday is expected to defend its acquisition of insurer Aetna on both the legal front and to investors. CVS lawyers will appear in a federal court for the start of a 3-day proceeding in which U.S. District Judge Richard Leon is considering whether the Justice Department adequately protected competition when it approved the deal last year. Meanwhile, the company is also holding an investor day to discuss its outlook, with analysts looking for evidence that CVS can improve its financial performance amid challenges to its core businesses. Judge Leon is considering whether to approve the settlement between the companies and the Justice Department. Judges typically give the nod to such settlements as a matter of routine—and without extended consideration—but Judge Leon made clear he has concerns about the deal. Investors are looking for specifics around CVS's plans to build up its health care role in the wake of the merger, according to analysts, including through new health hub stores designed to offer a broader range of services, many aimed at those with chronic illnesses.
