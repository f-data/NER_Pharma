Only days after the world wept for Paris as Notre Dame burned, France’s biggest drugmaker is pledging a €10 million to help restore the monument at the heart of its home city.
Sanofi committed the donation via Twitter Wednesday. In a statement, CEO Olivier Brandicourt said the cathedral had “survived for centuries” and Sanofi would help make sure that doesn't change. The drugmaker “can be proud that our company is participating in its restoration for future generations,” he said.

Sanofi joins many others contributing toward restoring the cathedral after Monday's blaze. The billionaire Pinault family started the donations with a €100 million commitment, and the Arnault family followed with a €200 million contribution, the Wall Street Journal reports.
L’Oreal and its top shareholder, the Bettencourt Meyers family, plus the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, are giving €200 million, according to the newspaper. French oil company Total contributed €100 million as well, its CEO tweeted. And in total, the rebuilding fund reached $1 billion as of Wednesday morning, AP reports.
