The U.S. biosims market has been notoriously slow to generate meaningful savings or price reductions, and now some experts say it’s time to scrap the idea altogether. Instead of using biosims and competition to lower prices for high-cost biologics, the experts suggest creating an independent body to set prices after the meds lose exclusivity.
In fact, the U.S. could save $50 billion a year by using cost-plus or other formulas to set prices for biologics after their exclusivity wraps up, the authors figure—up to 10 times the amount biosims are estimated to shave off annual spending.
In their two-part Health Affairs article, authors Preston Atteberry, Peter Bach, Jennifer Ohn and Mark Trusheim argue that biologic drugs enjoy a “natural monopoly,” while small molecule drugs are only protected by regulations that give them exclusive access to a market.
In other words, biosims are costly to develop and tough to manufacture, and even when they hit the market, there's no guarantee of a payoff. Biosim makers have to shell out for marketing, too, and negotiate with payers as well. On the other hand, traditional generics typically don't require clinical trials, production is less complicated and they're automatically substituted for branded drugs at the pharmacy counter.
Getting into the biosims business requires clearing some high hurdles and ponying up large sums of money. Not so much with small-molecule copycats; their biggest obstacles are patent rights.
As a result—and as has been well-documented—biosims haven’t had much effect on drug prices or savings in the U.S. Generic drugs, on the other hand, quickly lower prices, thanks to plenty of competition as soon as a brand loses its lock on the market.
