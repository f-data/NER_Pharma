The manager of a Boots pharmacy in east Dunbartonshire, Scotland, has won The Pharmaceutical Journal’s 2019 writing competition with a piece about a troubling experience rationalising opioid use in a patient.
The entry was one of almost 30 submitted to the competition by pharmacists, pre-registration trainees and pharmacy students under the theme “The patient who changed my practice”.
In 2019, Rory Wemyss, who has been a pharmacist for two years, became the second winner of the contest. Mark Borthwick, a consultant pharmacist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, won the 2018 competition with his entry ‘2039: Pharmacy after the fall’.
Other commended entries in the 2019 competition came from Ade Williams, a community pharmacist in Bristol; Nana Tomova, a mental health pharmacist in Sussex; Sophie Oduyale, a PhD researcher in Reading; and John Wood, a retired pharmacist in Birmingham.
Emma Boxer won the prize for the best entry from a pharmacist in training. She has now qualified.
All the commended entries will be published in the August 2019 issue of The Pharmaceutical Journal and Wemyss will receive an Amazon Fire tablet for his winning entry.
