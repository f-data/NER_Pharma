FDA approved on Thursday eculizumab (Solirisâ€”Alexion Pharmaceuticals) injection for I.V. use for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. The rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. "Soliris provides the first FDA-approved treatment for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a debilitating disease that profoundly impacts patients' lives," said Billy Dunn, MD, director of the Division of Neurology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This approval changes the landscape of therapy for patients with NMOSD." The drug carries a boxed warning about life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections that have occurred in individuals treated with eculizumab. Such infections may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized or treated early. Eculizumab is only available via a restricted program through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), FDA said. Prescribers must enroll in the REMS program. Additionally, they must advise patients about the risk of meningococcal infection, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials, and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine(s). The most commonly reported adverse reactions by patients in the NMOSD clinical trial included upper respiratory infection, common cold, diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, influenza, joint pain, sore throat, and contusion.
