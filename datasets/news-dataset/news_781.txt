Shortages of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have prompted the British Menopause Society (BMS) to issue guidance on the supplies that are currently available.
Following reports of up to half of HRT products being out of stock, the update on product availability is intended for BMS members, clinicians and patients who may be experiencing difficulties in obtaining HRT supplies.
Haitham Hamoda, chair of the BMS, said there had been “availability issues with many HRT products”.
“Some of these are related to manufacturing shortages, while others are related to supply issues. The BMS has been reassured that these are temporary shortages which pharmaceutical companies and their suppliers are trying to resolve,” he added.
Information on stock availability and supplies was obtained by the BMS from the manufacturers of HRT products.
The products in short supply include Evorel patches, manufactured by Janssen, and some HRT products manufactured by Mylan.
Hamoda said prescribers dealing with shortages “can consider equivalent preparations that provide a similar dose to what their patient is using”.
“If an exact match is not possible, prescribers can seek guidance available on the practical prescribing chart on the BMS website and Menopause Matters website to clarify equivalent doses,” he added.
