With its Alzheimer's trial flop still smarting, Biogen's infusing new blood into its board. But now, one nominee for the expanded slate is bowing out.
Catalent CEO John Chiminski withdrew from the race after his company bought a gene therapy player, Paragon Bioservices, creating a potential conflict of interest. And at least for now, Biogen isn’t planning to nominate a replacement.
Still, Biogen’s board is “committed to ensuring that it is well-equipped to oversee the company’s business and effectively represent the interests of stockholders," the company said in an SEC filing. It’ll keep scouting new directors to add to its board, the filing said.
