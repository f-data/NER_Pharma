That explosion, in turn, followed one in March at a chemical plant in eastern Jiangsu province that killed 78 and injured hundreds. Those blasts again raised questions about the safety conditions at pharma plants in China.
In 2015, a massive fire and explosions in the Tianjin industrial port in China killed 160 people and left a massive area of destruction. GlaxoSmithKline had to stop production at a plant in the area following the blasts. No GSK workers were hurt by the nearby event, but the facility was damaged.
