CDC recorded 41 new cases of measles in the past week, bringing the total for this year's outbreak to 880. Thirty of the new cases were in New York state, especially in New York City and suburban Rockland County. Cases of measles have now been reported in 24 states. A CDC spokesperson noted that it is too early to determine whether the outbreak is slowing down. According to the spokesperson, an outbreak of geographically related measles cases is not considered to have ended until 42 days—two consecutive 21-day incubation periods—have passed without any new cases. Experts note that measles transmission often slows when warmer summer weather arrives, though it is not clear whether that is the result of children no longer being in close contact at school, families spending less time inside, or because virus-laden droplets stay airborne longer in cold, dry air than in warm, humid air.
