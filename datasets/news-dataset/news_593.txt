If you’ve been sitting on your nominations for this year’s Fiercest Women in Life Sciences, don’t wait too long! Now is the perfect time to submit them as nominations will close in two weeks.
To recap, we’re looking for women in biotech, pharma and medtech who, in spite of challenges both unique to the industry and to being female, stand out as leaders, innovators and mentors. They can be industry professionals, academics, venture capitalists—you name it.
We are often asked if we have a list of criteria for consideration. We don’t. If a particular woman is making a mark on the life sciences industry, we want to hear about her.
