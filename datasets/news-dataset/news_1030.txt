President Trump signed on Wednesday an executive order aimed at improving medical care for people with kidney disease. The order calls on federal agencies to educate and treat people with early forms of kidney disease, to make kidney transplants easier to obtain, and to shift the financial incentives for clinics and physicians away from the current system, which relies heavily on dialysis. "The result will be more and faster transplants for those in need," Trump said. HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II noted in a briefing Wednesday morning, "For 50 years, we have had basically a stagnant system of how we treat people with chronic kidney disease." Azar has made kidney disease a priority because his father was on dialysis for several years and eventually required a kidney transplant. The president's goal aims to lower costs by encouraging in-home dialysis and organ donation. Statistics show that some 37 million adults have chronic kidney disease. Tonya Saffer, the vice president for health policy at the National Kidney Foundation, praised the president's focus on kidney care. "We are very optimistic and excited that there is great attention at the presidential level," she said. "It's really been 4 decades since anybody has paid attention to this space in a very meaningful way."
