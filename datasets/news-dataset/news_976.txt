FDA on Friday approved onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma—AveXis), a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The ultrarare disease affects infants. In announcing the approval, Novartis—which acquired AveXis last year—also disclosed the price of the drug, $2.1 million. The company noted that it would provide rebates to insurance companies if the drug is not successful, though it did not offer details about what would be considered failure. Novartis also said it will set up 5-year payment plans for states, small insurance firms, and self-insured employers. Another drug, nusinersen (Spinraza—Biogen) is already available for the treatment of SMA; however, that drug must continue to be injected into patients' spines throughout their lives, at a cost of $750,000 in the first year and $375,000 a year after that. "Patients with SMA now have another treatment option to minimize the progression of SMA and improve survival," said Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
