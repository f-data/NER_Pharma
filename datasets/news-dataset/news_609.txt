Biotech and pharma CEOs are used to having their words recorded. Whether it's at an investor conference, an industry confab, a press conference or a quarterly earnings call, CEO statements end up everywhere from webcasts to reporters' notebooks.
Sometimes, those statements aren't just facts. They're pledges of one kind or another. And while executives often hold true to their public statements, sometimes they just don't.
This fall, we’re planning to highlight the biggest promises made and broken by biopharma execs in recent years—and we’re turning to readers to help compile the list.

Be it a promise not to raise prices or settle a lawsuit, a promise to hit a particular long-term sales target, a promise not to sell a company, unforeseen layoffs, misleading M&A comments or more, we want to hear your ideas for the upcoming feature. Anytime a pharma CEO said one thing and did another, that’s worth noting.
We’ll plan to highlight a group of the broken promises in a special report this October. Please share your ideas in this form. Nominations are open until Aug. 30. Questions in the meantime? Feel free to get in touch through email or Twitter.
