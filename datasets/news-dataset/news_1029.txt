The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday released a bipartisan drug-pricing proposal that would cap older adults' out-of-pocket costs and limit price increases in Medicare. However, the legislation faces opposition from the pharmaceutical industry and conservative groups. The proposal from Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-IA) and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden (OR), would save the government about $100 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The measure would also save older adults $27 billion in out-of-pocket costs over that period and $5 billion from slightly lower premiums, according to the CBO. The White House endorsed the proposal and said it would build support among senators. The House plans to unveil its own drug pricing proposal in September, Wendell Primus, top health aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), said Monday. That bill will allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of some drugs and is unlikely to receive Republican support. The Grassley-Wyden bill would cap out-of-pocket costs for those receiving Medicare's prescription drug benefit at $3,100 a year starting in 2022, while limiting drug price increases to the rate of inflation. Drugmakers that raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation would have to pay a rebate to the federal government.
