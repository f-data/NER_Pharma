FDA has expanded the indication for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Symdeko—Vertex) tablets for the treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene or at least one mutation that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The agency last year approved tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with the same specific genetic mutations. "Today's approval of Symdeko for children as young as 6 years old provides an important treatment option for younger patients, and also provides more context on the safety and dosing specific to this population," said Banu Karimi-Shah, MD, acting deputy director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The efficacy of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in patients aged 6–12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years and older, with additional support from data in patients aged 6–12 years, FDA said. The product's safety in patients aged 6 years to less than 12 years was supported by data from a study that included a 24-week, open-label treatment period with 70 patients and had similar observations of safety to clinical trials for patients aged 12 years and older. The most common adverse effects include headache, nausea, sinus congestion, and dizziness. Tezacaftor/ivacaftor should always be taken with food that contains fat and never in combination with certain antibiotics, seizure medicines, St. John's wort, or food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges, as noted on the label.
