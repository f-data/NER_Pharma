Boehringer Ingelheim intends to make a significant investment in its three manufacturing sites in Mexico in the next three years, starting with its site near Mexico City where it makes diabetes meds.
The drugmaker today said it will invest about 1 billion Mexican pesos ($52 million) over the next two years in its Xochimilco site, a sum that should boost capacity. The goal is to increase production to 2.5 billion tablets annually in 2028 from about 1.6 billion tablets now, the company said, according to a translated story in Milenio.

The plant expansion, which will allow the German drugmaker to increase export capacity to the U.S. as well as to Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, was announced by Miguel Salazar, CEO of Boehringer in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, according to the report.
The expansion at the Xochimilco plant is part of an investment plan to invest 1.6 billion pesos ($84 million) by 2023 to boost production at all three of its production sites in the country, Manufacturing Chemist reports.
The expansion in Mexico comes as the company has made some changes in the way it treats newer, more complex products as opposed to older products that are easier to manufacture.
Last year, Boehringer started construction on a $100 million R&D and manufacturing facility in Germany where it will both develop and manufacture more complex tablets for global launches. At the same time, it is moving production of what it calls “older, easier-to-manufacture drugs” to other sites worldwide.
