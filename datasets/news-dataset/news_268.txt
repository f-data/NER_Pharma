For decades, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals gave away the unapproved drug amifampridine to patients with a rare neuromuscular disorder called LEMS. Then, Catalyst Pharma licensed certain rights to the drug, scored an FDA nod, and priced the med at $375,000 a year.
An outcry ensued. But now, the FDA may have given patients a workaround. Jacobus won approval Monday for a drug that won’t be a direct competitor to Catalyst's, but could pose an off-label threat, Oppenheimer analysts said.
Jacobus’ drug, Ruzurgi, is approved to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in patients 6 to less than 17 years old. Catalyst's Firdapse is approved in adults, who make up most of the patient pool. But doctors are free to prescribe drugs off label if they choose.
Jacobus’ approval was enough to spook Catalyst investors, who sent shares down about 40% after the news. But the actual threat to Catalyst's Firdapse isn’t yet clear, the Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a Monday evening note.
