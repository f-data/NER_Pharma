FDA on Friday cautioned patients and health care professionals about the risks of using unapproved or unauthorized devices for diabetes management. In a new safety communication, FDA said that using unapproved or unauthorized devices could lead to inaccurate blood glucose measurements or unsafe insulin dosing. "Millions of Americans use continuous glucose monitors and insulin delivery devices to monitor and treat their diabetes," said Jeff Shuren, MD, JD, director of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. "Because of the complexity of these devices and the life-saving care they provide, it's important that patients are aware of the risks that arise when they're not used as intended or when they use devices not authorized for sale in the U.S. By using products that have not been reviewed by the agency for safety and effectiveness, patients with diabetes may be putting themselves at risk for serious injury or even death." FDA noted it is aware of some manufacturers illegally marketing unauthorized devices for diabetes management or illegally marketing components that patients may integrate into unauthorized automated dosing systems. Also, some patients may combine devices or components that are not intended for use with other devices. The agency expressed concern that patients may not be aware of all the risks involved with using components or systems not reviewed by FDA. According to a serious adverse event report received by FDA, a patient's use of an illegally marketed continuous glucose monitoring system along with an unauthorized insulin dosing system led to an insulin overdose that required medical attention.
