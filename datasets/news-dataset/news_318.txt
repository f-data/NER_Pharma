Indivior lied and cheated its way to billions of dollars in Suboxone sales, according to a new federal indictment that details a yearslong marketing scheme to pump up sales.
Prosecutors are eyeing a $3 billion judgment in the case, which alleges that Indivior exaggerated the benefits of Suboxone Film, a new version of its older opioid dependence pill. The drugmaker generated billions of dollars by “deceiving" doctors into "believing that Suboxone Film is safer and less susceptible to diversion and abuse than other, similar drugs,” the indictment states.
Indivior also used underhanded tactics to move patients to the film formulation, the indictment states. The company developed Suboxone Film around 2007 as its patent protections for the original tablet were running out, and then, without any evidence to support its claims, marketed Suboxone Film as safer and less prone to child exposure, the government alleges.
Next, to delay generic versions of the tablet and switch patients to the film, Indivior withdrew the pill on false concerns of exposure to children, the indictment says.
The company also set up an internet and telephone program for patients to connect with doctors about their opioid dependence, the government says. Indivior intentionally matched those patients with doctors who were prescribing Suboxone in a “careless and clinically unwarranted manner," the indictment alleges.
Authorities are demanding $3 billion for the company’s alleged illicit marketing, plus forfeiture of Indivior assets such as bank accounts and patents. The government alleges health care fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud, along with conspiracy to commit each of those crimes.
