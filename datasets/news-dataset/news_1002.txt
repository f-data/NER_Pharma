FDA on Wednesday granted accelerated approval to selinexor (Xpovioâ€”Karyopharm Therapeutics) tablets in combination with the corticosteroid dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior therapies and whose disease is resistant to several other forms of treatment, including at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. "While there is no cure for multiple myeloma, there are FDA-approved treatments to target the cancer and slow down the spread of the disease. Sadly, often over time, patients can exhaust all available treatments and still see their disease progress," said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Today we approved a treatment under our accelerated approval program that provides a treatment option for patients with multiple myeloma with no available therapy." Efficacy was evaluated in 83 patients with RRMM who were treated with Xpovio in combination with dexamethasone. At the end of the study, the overall response rate was measured at 25.3%. The median time to first response was 4 weeks, with a range of 1 to 10 weeks. The median duration of response was 3.8 months. The efficacy evaluation was supported by additional information from an ongoing, randomized trial in patients with multiple myeloma.
