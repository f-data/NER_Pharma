Vertex Pharmaceuticals chalked up some big wins in 2018: It launched its third cystic fibrosis drug, Symdeko, for one, and grew revenue by a hefty 40%. Altogether, it was an "extraordinary" year, the company figures—and enough to win CEO Jeffrey Leiden a 9% pay boost.
Leiden pulled in $18.8 million, thanks to a hefty bump to his equity-based pay. His salary held steady for 2018 at $1.3 million, and he took home a slightly thinner packet of cash incentive pay at $3.44 million.
But his stock and option awards jumped by nearly $1.6 million to more than $12 million, Vertex disclosed in a proxy filing. And that made the difference, taking his total up to $18.8 million from $17.2 million in 2017.
Leiden's pay package ranks him just outside of biopharma's top 10 best-paid CEOs of 2018, based on available proxy filings. The Vertex chief comes in 11th, behind former Pfizer helmsman Ian Read with $19.5 million.
It’s also worth noting that Vertex’s former Chief Operating Officer Ian Smith, who was fired earlier this year for misconduct, pulled in a $4.6 million pay package last year. That figure didn’t include cash incentive pay, which Smith had earned in previous years.
