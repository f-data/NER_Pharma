Eye med Eylea has been a blockbuster sales force for Regeneron, but Novartisâ€™ challenger brolucizumab is on the horizon. Could a new delivery option give Eylea a leg up?
That's what Regeneron's hoping. The FDA Tuesday approved a new prefilled injector for 2-milligram single doses of Eylea to treat patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.
The drugmaker touted the new approval as a game-changer for physicians, taking multiple preparation steps out of the original vial dose regimen. Eylea is now the only drug approved to treat four retinal diseases with a single-dose prefilled injector, although Roche's Lucentis has two prefilled injector doses that cover all four of those indications separately.
