Bristol-Myers Squibb is taking on a debt load to cover its $74 billion Celgene buyout, and it issued $19 billion in bonds Tuesday to help pay the bill.
Bristol-Myers issued bonds in nine tranches that come due starting next year and stretch all the way out into 2049. In all, Bristol wants to take on $32 billion in new debt itself, plus $20 billion in Celgene debt, to fund the deal, the drugmaker said in a presentation (PDF) outlining the proposed merger.
But BMS doesn't plan to carry that burden for long. Company executives have said they're planning to quickly put their money to work paying down that load. The combined company would have $45 billion in free cash flow in the first three years after closing, BMS has said.
