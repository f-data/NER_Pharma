A research letter published in JAMA Network found that deaths from falls among adults 75 years and older increased from 2000 to 2016. The absolute number of deaths from falls rose from more than 8,600 in 2000 to more than 25,000 in 2016. Deaths from falls in older patients are generally attributed to age, medication use, poor balance, and chronic conditions.
Researchers analyzed deaths from falls from the U.S. National Vital Statistics System mortality files. They found that mortality rates increased with age and throughout the study period. In 2016, for example, persons aged 75 to 79 years old experienced a rate of 42 deaths per 100,000 compared with 591 deaths per 100, 000 in persons 95 years and older.
Adjusting for age distributions, rates of death from falls increased from about 61 per 100,000 men in 2000 to about 116 per 100,000 in 2016. Among women, rates increased from about 46 per 100,000 in 2000 to about 106 per 100,000 in 2016.
The researchers wrote that some limitations could be the data source, since the U.S. Census Bureau might undercount those older than age 65 and possibly “results in an overestimation of death rates.”
Medication use is one modifiable risk factor that can help prevent falls, and pharmacists are well positioned to identify older adults who are at risk.
CDC’s Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) initiative provides members of the health care team, including pharmacists, with applicable tools and resources.
The National Council on Aging’s (NCOA) 2015 National Falls Prevention Action Plan also emphasizes risks associated with medications and urges all older adults to know that falling is a common adverse effect of some prescription and even nonprescription medications.
